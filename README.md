 # Octopvs
 Version 0.0.1
 
 Currently, Octopvs is just a program that retrieves data from NHL players into CSV files.
 It works by automatic access to NHL team's roster links and retrieval of public data currently available to everyone.
 
 My plans are to create an easily acessible database where users could make queries on their own.
 
 # The biggest con so far is that, due to verification in order to avoid duplicates, 
 if you wish to update the whole database it is much simpler to just delete the whole thing 
 and download it again than to update it.
